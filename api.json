      "full": "The Sedona Vortexes are specific geographic locations in Sedona, Arizona, believed by New Age practitioners to contain swirling centers of energy conducive to healing, meditation, and spiritual experiences. The four primary vortex sites—Bell Rock, Cathedral Rock, Airport Mesa, and Boynton Canyon—have become international destinations for spiritual seekers, despite the absence of scientific evidence for the claimed energy fields. These locations coincide with geologically unique red rock formations and areas considered sacred by Native American peoples, particularly the Yavapai-Apache Nation. The phenomenon represents a complex intersection of Indigenous spirituality, New Age beliefs, geological wonder, and modern tourism."
